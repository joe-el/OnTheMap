# On the Map
Udacity Project: On The Map

On The Map is one of several Portfolio Apps for the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It shows information posted by other students on a map containing pins showing the location where other students location. The apps purpose is to showcase implementing networking requests, including GET, POST (including Authentication), PUT and DELETE. It also uses MapKit.

# The App
On The Map has a tab navigation, with a Map View and a List View of students' locations. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

# Requirements
You need to have Udacity credentials in order to log in.
This application was built using Xcode 10.1 and can be run on iOS 12.1 devices or simulators

# Why this project?
This project will give us, the students, an opportunity to post and retrieve data from a network resource using Apple’s networking framework. It will also allow us to authenticate a user.

# What did I learn?
Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
Authenticating a user using over a network connection
Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map

# Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Working with data from networked sources is as important to iOS development as creating good user interfaces. Completing this project showed us that a developer can both read and write from RESTful networked APIs.
